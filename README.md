The goal of tf-graphgen serves as a helper library for tensorflow symbolic graph generation. The aim was to take the relatively verbose yet repetetive code that had to be written to instantiate the symbolic graph and condense + abstact it
in such a way that kept the general purpose of the library clear to the end-user.
